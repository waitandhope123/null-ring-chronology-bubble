# null-ring-chronology-bubble
A classical GR toy model of a Kerr-like exotic compact object with a hidden chronology-violating core, constrained by modern observations (LIGO, EHT, lensing). Explores how rotating null stress-energy could create a localized time-loop region while remaining observationally Kerr-like.
