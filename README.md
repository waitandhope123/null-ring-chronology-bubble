# Null Ring Chronology Bubble (NRCB)

**A classical general-relativistic toy model of a Kerr-like exotic compact object with a hidden chronology-violating inner region, constrained by modern observations.**

---

## Overview

This repository explores a **conceptual framework in classical General Relativity (GR)** for an exotic compact object that is observationally indistinguishable from a rotating (Kerr) black hole at accessible scales, while admitting — deep in its interior — a **localized region of closed timelike curves (CTCs)** produced by extreme frame dragging from rotating null (lightlike) stress–energy.

The model is intentionally conservative: all exotic causal structure is confined to regions that current observations cannot resolve, ensuring consistency with existing experimental data.

This project is **theoretical and conceptual only**. It does *not* propose a physical construction or engineering pathway.

## Core Idea (Plain Language)

- Spinning mass–energy twists spacetime (frame dragging).
- In extreme conditions, this twisting can tilt causal structure.
- If pushed far enough, classical GR permits localized time-loop regions.
- Modern data (LIGO, EHT, lensing) tightly constrain where such effects could exist.
- Any such region must be **small, deeply hidden, and observationally invisible**.

The NRCB model lives precisely in that narrow allowed window.

## Observational Constraints Used

This framework is explicitly constrained by real, modern data:

- **Gravitational waves** (LIGO / Virgo): inspiral and ringdown behavior must match Kerr predictions.
- **Black hole imaging** (EHT): photon ring and shadow geometry must remain Kerr-like.
- **Gravitational lensing** (strong, weak, microlensing): no exotic lensing signatures allowed externally.
- **Stellar orbits** (e.g., Sgr A*): orbital dynamics must remain consistent with GR.
- **Weak-field tests** (Solar System, GPS, frame dragging): unchanged from GR.

Any deviation from these constraints would falsify the model.

## Model Status

- ✅ Conceptually complete at the classical GR level  
- ✅ Observationally constrained and data-aware  
- ✅ Explicit about limitations and failure modes  

- ❌ No explicit metric written
- ❌ No numerical simulations
- ❌ No quantum gravity treatment

Quantum effects (Hawking-style chronology protection) are expected to destabilize or censor the chronology-violating region in any realistic completion.

## What This Is (and Is Not)

**This is:**
- A classical GR toy model
- An Exotic Compact Object (ECO) framework
- A synthesis of known GR behavior under modern observational constraints

**This is not:**
- A proposal for a time machine
- A construction or engineering design
- A claim about physical realizability
- A quantum gravity theory

## Repository Structure (Planned)

```text
docs/        – Conceptual explanations and model definition
theory/      – Assumptions, parameters, notation
figures/     – Diagrams and spacetime schematics
notes/       – Rough ideas and references
```

## Motivation

The purpose of this project is to explore how far classical gravity can be pushed — honestly and carefully — before it breaks, using the strongest observational constraints currently available.

It represents the boundary between:
what General Relativity allows in principle, and
what the universe appears to permit in practice.
