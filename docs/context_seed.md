# Context Seed

This repository is intended as a **conceptual anchor**, not a finished theory.

The Null Ring Chronology Bubble (NRCB) was developed as a disciplined exploration of how far classical General Relativity can be pushed while remaining consistent with modern observational constraints. Every component of this project is shaped by what has already been measured, imaged, or tested.

The intent is not to assert physical reality, but to **map the boundary** between:
- what General Relativity permits mathematically,
- what observations constrain experimentally,
- and where quantum effects are expected to intervene.

## How to Read This Project

This repository should be read as:

- a synthesis of known GR behavior,
- a constrained thought experiment,
- and a structured framework for discussion.

It is **not** a proposal for construction, prediction, or intervention.

All toy models and visualizations are pedagogical.  
All exotic behavior is intentionally hidden beyond current observational reach.  
All claims are provisional and falsifiable.

## Design Philosophy

Three guiding principles shaped this work:

1. **Observations dominate speculation**  
   If a feature contradicts data (LIGO, EHT, lensing, orbits), it is discarded.

2. **Continuity over novelty**  
   Any viable theory of gravity must reproduce Kerr-like behavior where tested.  
   Novelty is confined to unprobed regimes only.

3. **Honesty about limits**  
   Quantum backreaction, instability, and chronology protection are not avoided — they are acknowledged as likely endpoints.

## What This Seed Enables

This context seed exists so the NRCB framework can act as:

- a reference point for discussing causality in strong gravity,
- a pedagogical example of data-constrained speculation,
- a starting scaffold for formalization or falsification,
- or a boundary marker indicating where classical GR likely fails.

Future work may:
- formalize a metric,
- attempt numerical exploration,
- or demonstrate instability conclusively.

All such outcomes are acceptable — including failure.

## Closing Note

The value of this project lies not in whether the NRCB exists in nature,  
but in **how clearly it shows the edges of our current understanding**.

In that sense, this repository is complete for its intended purpose —  
and intentionally incomplete beyond it.
