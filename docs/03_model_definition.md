# Model Definition: The Null Ring Chronology Bubble

This document defines the Null Ring Chronology Bubble (NRCB) as a classical general-relativistic toy model. It specifies the spacetime structure, source assumptions, and intended causal behavior without committing to an explicit metric.

---

## Spacetime Classification

The NRCB spacetime is assumed to be:

- **Stationary**: invariant under time translations.
- **Axisymmetric**: invariant under rotations about a single axis.
- **Asymptotically flat**: approaching Minkowski spacetime at large distances.

These are the same symmetry assumptions used for rotating black holes and allow direct comparison with the Kerr solution.

---

## External Geometry Requirement

For all radii accessible to observation, the NRCB metric must be **indistinguishable from the Kerr spacetime** with parameters:

- Total mass \( M \)
- Total angular momentum \( J \)

This requirement is enforced to ensure consistency with:

- Gravitational-wave observations (inspiral and ringdown)
- Black hole imaging (photon ring and shadow geometry)
- Stellar orbital dynamics
- Gravitational lensing measurements

Any detectable deviation from Kerr behavior outside the inner core falsifies the model.

---

## Source Structure

Instead of a classical matter singularity, the NRCB interior is sourced by a compact, rotating distribution of **null stress–energy**:

- The source is idealized as a **ring-like configuration**.
- Stress–energy is lightlike (radiative), not massive.
- The configuration carries the total angular momentum \( J \).

The null ring is not required to represent a realistic material object; it acts as an effective source encoding extreme rotational energy density.

## Radial Region Decomposition

The spacetime is conceptually divided into four regions:

### Region A — Asymptotic Zone
- Weak gravitational field.
- Spacetime approximates flat space.
- No exotic causal behavior.

### Region B — Strong Frame-Dragging Zone
- Geometry closely matches Kerr exterior.
- Strong frame dragging and time dilation occur.
- Causality remains globally well behaved.

### Region C — Chronology Horizon
- Critical radius where light cones tilt to the causal limit.
- Closed **null** curves first become possible.
- Acts as the boundary of the chronology-violating region.

### Region D — Chronology Bubble
- Compact inner region where light cones tilt beyond the critical angle.
- **Closed timelike curves (CTCs)** exist.
- Worldlines can locally move forward in proper time while globally looping in coordinate time.

This region is finite, localized, and deeply hidden.

---

## Event Horizon Avoidance

Unlike Kerr black holes, the NRCB is defined to be **horizonless**:

- The metric is tuned to prevent formation of a true event horizon.
- The chronology bubble exists just outside where a Kerr horizon would normally form.
- External observers remain causally connected to the entire spacetime.

This places the NRCB within the category of horizonless exotic compact objects.

---

## Causal Interpretation

Time looping in NRCB is not instantaneous or discontinuous:

- No portals, jumps, or singular transitions occur.
- All trajectories are smooth and continuous.
- Closed timelike curves arise purely from spacetime geometry.

From the traveler’s perspective, time always flows forward locally.

---

## Classical Validity and Limitations

The NRCB is strictly a **classical GR construction**:

- No claims are made about quantum stability.
- Quantum backreaction and chronology protection are expected to destabilize Region C or D.
- The model should be viewed as a limiting case of classical spacetime behavior.

---

## Design Goals Summary

The NRCB is defined to satisfy:

- Kerr-like behavior wherever observations exist.
- Localization of exotic causal structure.
- Absence of unphysical matter sources.
- Conceptual clarity without over-specification.

---

## Model Status

At present, NRCB consists of:
- A spacetime classification
- A causal structure specification
- A set of observational constraints

Future work would require explicit metrics, numerical solutions, and quantum stability analysis.
