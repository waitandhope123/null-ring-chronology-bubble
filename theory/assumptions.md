# Core Assumptions

This document lists the foundational assumptions underlying the Null Ring Chronology Bubble (NRCB) framework. These assumptions define the scope and limits of the model.

---

## Gravitational Framework

- Gravity is described by **classical General Relativity** at all scales relevant to this model.
- Spacetime is treated as a smooth Lorentzian manifold.
- Einstein’s field equations govern the relationship between geometry and stress–energy.

Any future theory of gravity is assumed to reduce to GR in the regimes probed by current observations.

---

## Validity of GR in Observed Regimes

- GR accurately describes gravity in weak-field, strong-field, and radiative regimes where data exist.
- Deviations from GR, if they exist, occur only at scales below current observational access.
- Kerr spacetime correctly describes the exterior of rotating compact objects.

---

## Nature of the Source

- Energy, not mass alone, is the source of spacetime curvature.
- Light and radiation (null stress–energy) gravitate according to GR.
- The rotating null ring is treated as an **effective classical source**, not as a literal physical structure.

No exotic matter with negative energy density is assumed.

---

## Symmetry Assumptions

The spacetime is assumed to be:

- Stationary (time-independent globally)
- Axisymmetric (rotational symmetry about a single axis)
- Asymptotically flat (normal spacetime at large distances)

These symmetries are necessary to compare directly with Kerr spacetime.

---

## Causal Structure

- Causality is defined locally by light cones.
- Time orientation is well defined everywhere outside the chronology bubble.
- Closed timelike curves arise solely from geometric light-cone tilting.

No discontinuities, singular jumps, or non-geometric causal mechanisms are assumed.

---

## Horizon Avoidance

- The model assumes it is mathematically possible to tune parameters to avoid formation of a true event horizon.
- The absence of a horizon is a defining feature of the NRCB as an exotic compact object.
- This assumption is not guaranteed by GR and is treated as a conditional hypothesis.

---

## Classical Treatment Only

- Quantum gravity effects are not included.
- Quantum field backreaction is ignored at the level of construction.
- Any realistic completion is expected to violate classical assumptions near the chronology horizon.

This model is therefore **not** expected to be physically realized in nature.

---

## Observational Conservatism

- Observations take precedence over speculation.
- The model is constructed to remain observationally indistinguishable from Kerr wherever data exist.
- Any detectable deviation falsifies the framework.

---

## Summary

The NRCB rests on conservative assumptions intended to maximize compatibility with established physics while exploring the extreme causal limits of classical spacetime.
