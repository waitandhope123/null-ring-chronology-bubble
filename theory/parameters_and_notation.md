# Parameters and Notation

This document defines the symbols, parameters, and naming conventions used throughout the Null Ring Chronology Bubble (NRCB) framework. No equations are solved here; this file exists to maintain internal consistency.

## Fundamental Quantities

- **\( c \)** — Speed of light  
- **\( G \)** — Gravitational constant  
- **\( \hbar \)** — Reduced Planck constant (not explicitly used, but relevant for quantum limits)

Units are assumed to follow standard relativistic conventions where appropriate.

---

## Global Spacetime Parameters

- **\( M \)** — Total mass–energy of the object  
  - Defined by asymptotic gravitational behavior.
- **\( J \)** — Total angular momentum  
  - Determines rotational frame dragging.
- **\( a = J/M \)** — Kerr spin parameter (used for comparison only)

These parameters are defined observationally, not by interior structure.

---

## Radial Coordinates

- **\( r \)** — Generic radial coordinate
- **\( r_{\text{ext}} \)** — Radius beyond which the spacetime is observationally Kerr-like
- **\( r_{\text{ph}} \)** — Photon orbit radius (must match Kerr value)
- **\( r_{\text{c}} \)** — Chronology horizon radius
- **\( r_{\text{ring}} \)** — Effective radius of the rotating null ring source

The ordering is assumed to be:

\[
r_{\text{ring}} < r_{\text{c}} < r_{\text{ph}} < r_{\text{ext}}
\]

## Spacetime Regions

The NRCB spacetime is divided into four conceptual regions:

- **Region A** — Asymptotic zone  
  - Weak gravity, flat spacetime limit.

- **Region B** — Strong frame-dragging zone  
  - Kerr-like exterior behavior.

- **Region C** — Chronology horizon  
  - Boundary where light cones become critically tilted.
  - Closed null curves first appear.

- **Region D** — Chronology bubble  
  - Interior region containing closed timelike curves.
  - Compact and localized.

These regions are defined conceptually, not by sharp physical boundaries.

## Causal Objects

- **Timelike curve** — Worldline of a massive observer
- **Null curve** — Worldline of light or radiation
- **Closed timelike curve (CTC)** — A timelike worldline that returns to its starting spacetime point

Closed curves arise solely from geometric effects.

---

## Stress–Energy Description

- **Null stress–energy** — Energy–momentum carried by light or radiation
- **Rotating null ring** — Idealized source of angular momentum and curvature
- **Effective source** — A modeling abstraction, not a literal structure

The source is treated classically and continuously.

---

## Horizon Terminology

- **Event horizon** — A causal boundary preventing signals from escaping to infinity
- **Apparent horizon** — A locally defined surface indicating strong gravitational trapping

The NRCB is defined to avoid formation of a true event horizon.

---

## Quantum Terminology (Contextual Only)

- **Chronology protection** — Hypothesized quantum mechanism preventing stable CTCs
- **Backreaction** — Modification of spacetime due to quantum stress–energy
- **Planck scale** — Regime where classical GR is expected to fail

These concepts are discussed qualitatively only.

---

## Notational Conventions

- Exterior behavior is always compared to **Kerr spacetime**
- Interior structure is described without assuming Kerr extensions
- Observational constraints dominate over interior speculation

---

## Summary

This notation scheme is designed to keep the NRCB framework internally consistent while remaining flexible enough for future formalization or numerical investigation.
